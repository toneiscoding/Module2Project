# Getting Started with MyAnimeList :globe_with_meridians:

This app gives you the power to create an anime list of your choosing.  Let's say a friend suggested to watch a few animes, you do not know much about the animes, you come to MyAnimeList and search the Animes and hover over the Anime's Cover for a synopsis. 

You can also click the anime cover, to see #Rank, #Score, and #Popularity based off of a popular an open-source PHP & REST API for the “most active online anime + manga community and database” website Jikan API. You may also see how many #members the anime has, the #duration of the anime chose, #status if the anime is still airing or finished airing and the #rating of anime for example Naruto is PG-13 for Teens 13 or older.  

So if you like what you see, you may hover over the cover of the anime and then click the "Add To List+" button, and your chose anime will go into the "My List" category.  You can continue to search and add to your list or if you don't feel like having an anime on your list no longer, you may hover over the anime cover and click the "Remove From List-" button.

There you go is the basic function of MyAnimeList.  Enjoy and happy listing :information_desk_person:!  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
