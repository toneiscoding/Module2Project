*This app gives you the power to create an anime list of your choosing.  Let's say a friend suggested to watch a few animes, you do not know much about the animes, you come to MyAnimeList and search the Animes and hover over the Anime's Cover for a synopsis.

*You can also click the anime cover, to see #Rank, #Score, and #Popularity based off of a popular an open-source PHP & REST API for the “most active online anime + manga community and database” website Jikan API. You may also see how many #members the anime has, the #duration of the anime chose, #status if the anime is still airing or finished airing and the #rating of anime for example Naruto is PG-13 for Teens 13 or older.

*So if you like what you see, you may hover over the cover of the anime and then click the "Add To List+" button, and your chose anime will go into the "My List" category.  You can continue to search and add to your list or if you don't feel like having an anime on your list no longer, you may hover over the anime cover and click the "Remove From List-" button.
